The Data Analysis SQL file answers the questions requested in the assignment. 

Other interesting finds are: 
  - Charmane Griswold (id: 205000) has the highest salary of $129,492 and is male. He works in the Sales department with the title of Staff. He is 65 years old and was hired on 06/23/1990. 
  - The last name with the highest count is Baba. 226 employees have this last name.
  - April Foolsday is the name listed for employee number 499942.
